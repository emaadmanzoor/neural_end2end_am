# Neural End-to-End AM with Knet

[Knet](https://denizyuret.github.io/Knet.jl/latest) implementation for the [Neural End-to-End Learning for Computational Argumentation Mining](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P17/P17-1002.pdf) paper.

## Overview 

Computational argumentation mining (AM) deals with finding argumentation structures in text. This involves several subtasks, such as:
  * Separating argumentative units from non-argumentative units, also called ‘component segmentation’.
  * Classifying argument components into classes such as “Premise” or “Claim”.
  * Finding relations between argument components.
  * Classifying relations into classes such as “Support” or “Attack”
